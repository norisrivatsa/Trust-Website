                <div class="NNS-sec fade-section">
                    <p class="NNSp1 slide-in">
                        Sri Nori Narasimha Sastry (6 Feb 1900 – 3 Jan 1978) was an accomplished genius who excelled at every genre of Telugu literature and contributed to the culture of Telugu people, beyond his literary contributions. His contributions may be broadly grouped under four heads: a) as an active participant in the shaping of Telugu literature through Sāhiti Samiti, b) works in various genres of literature, c) as a critic of literature in his later years and d) upholding of Dharma through his personal example, writings and criticisms.

                        As an young man, he participated actively in the Sāhiti Samiti, being its Founder and Secretary. This Samiti, with the stalwarts of Telugu literature of twentieth century like Sarvasri Viswanatha Satyanarayana,  Devulapalli Krishna Sastry, Rayaprolu Subba Rao and Adavi Bapiraju as members shaped the direction that Telugu literature took in later years. The Samiti has encouraged young writers and brought out a magazine called Sāhitī which has been a force to reckon with. It has been said that without Sāhiti Samiti there would be no Telugu literature in the first half of twentieth century. From meter-bound poetry of the previous years, literature took a turn towards bhāva kavitvamu and prose gained more prominence both in the form of short stories and novels. Yet these changes happened without breaking a link with the past and the language used still being śiṣṭavyāvahārikamu (the standard register of the well-learned).
                    </p>
                    <p class="NNSp2 slide-in">
                        His participation was no mere activism. He wrote extensively and definitively in each of those genres. In traditional poetry, he translated the first three skandhas of Devi Bhagavatamu from Sanskrit, much like Potana’s translation of Bhagavatam. This work earned him the title of “Kavi Samrat”, conferred in a traditional manner by Jagadguru Sri Sri Sri Kalyanananda Bharati Swami varu, the head of Śrī Śṛṇgerī Śrī Virūpākṣa Śrī Pīṭha, Guntur. In prose, he wrote seven historical novels, which were widely read and made him well-known not merely in Andhra Pradesh but elsewhere in the country due to the translations (Rudramadevi), his works being prescribed as works for study (Vāghira, in 1960s and 1970s in AP) and even a film being made based on his work (Srinatha Kavi, starring N. T. Rama Rao and directed by Bapu, made in 1993). The distinguishing feature of his historical novels was that the hero in each one of them was a poet, not a king or a royal person. His plays are in prose, poetry and song and cover topics from the ancient (Ramayana, Mahabharata, Buddha’s time etc.) to the present times. Finally, his prose essays are each a masterpiece. In Sanskrit, it is held that prose is the toughest genre (kavīnāṃ nikaṣaṃ gadyam), as each and every word needs to be measured. Telugu prose does not usually measure up to such standards, but the essays of Sri Nori Narasimha Sastry are extremely well-composed reminiscent of the ideals of Sanskrit prose. He also wrote one short novel / long story for children called Karpūradvīpayātra, which shows the delicate side of the poet. In this way, he excelled at each of the genres and left his own distinct stamp. His works are listed below
                    </p>
                    <p class="NNSp3 slide-in">
                        
                        In his later years, as an elderly statesman of Telugu literature, he wrote thoughtful and thought-provoking criticisms of the then literature, in a sense passing the baton of good standards. His reviews are such a joy to read and of a consistently high quality. He also served the Andhra Pradesh Sahitya Akademi in various capacities as a special member, executive committee member and Vice-president.

                    </p>
                    <p class="NNSp4 slide-in">There is an underlying thread running all through his work – the teaching of Dharma. While Veda teaches Dharma authoritatively, like a king; Puranas and Itihasas teach Dharma like a friend, in a straight forward manner; literature is supposed to teach Dharma like a woman, in a very attractive manner, if slightly round about manner. This is the purpose of all literature. Sri Nori Narasimha Sastry adhered to Dharma in his personal life and infused the same into each of his works. For his instance his essay on the best Telugu king (not Sri Krishna Devaraya, but Pedakomati Vema Reddy according to him) shows how Dharma is the standard with which kings ought to be evaluated. Each of his plays bring out particular aspects of Dharma in subtle ways, as do his historical novels and stories. Thus, the works of Sri Nori are not merely entertaining and of high quality, but live up to the ancient ideal that all literature needs to teach Dharma in an attractive manner.</p>

            <p class="NSSpara">
                Sri Nori Subramanya Sastry, born on October 25, 1941, to the late Kavi Samrat Sri Nori Narasimha Sastry and Hanumayamma, completed his education with an L.C.E. in 1961 at Uyyur. Shortly thereafter, he married Annapoorna. After relocating to Hyderabad, he balanced family responsibilities with pursuing a B.E. and M.E. at Osmania University. In 1962, he joined IICT (formerly R.R. Labs), where he worked until 1983, when he opted for voluntary retirement to embark on a career as a consultant civil engineer.
            </p>
            <p class="NSSpara">
                During his tenure at IICT, he was instrumental in founding the Lions Club of Snehapuri, serving in various capacities, and played a key role in the Nacharam Industrial Pollution Control Awareness Programme. As a dedicated member of the R.R. Labs Scientific Workers Association, he was unanimously elected President of the Scientists Welfare Association, a role he held for over 15 years. He also made significant contributions to the development of Snehapuri Colony.
            </p>
            <p class="NSSpara">
                Later in life, with the encouragement of his wife Annapoorna,he followed his spiritual aspirations and took deeksha at Sri Sringeri Sri Virupaksha Sri Peetham. Initiated by Sri Kalyananda Bharati Mantacharya Mahaswami Varu, he received deeksha from Sri Nrusimhananda Bharati Mahaswami Varu, adopting the name Poornanadanatha. His goals now include serving Sri Vidya and contributing to literature. He has authored several spiritual books, including Anandobrahmeti, Sri Kalyanahrudayam, Sadasivanugrahada, Aatmatatvamulu, Sri Shankara Hrudayam, Beejakshara Nighantuvu, and Madhuvidya Darshanam. He has performed over 700 Sri Chakra archanas till date.

            <h2><b>Founding of the Trust</b></h2>
            <p id="trustfound">
                In 1999, Sri Chekuri Rama Rao (Chera) met Sri Nori Subramanya Sastry and reminded him that the year 2000 would mark the centenary of his father, Kavi Samrat Sri Nori Narasimha Sastry. Chera also noted that Vijayawada Book Publications holds an annual December event to honor centenary authors and their families. Consequently, Sri Nori Subramanya Sastry was invited and felicitated at their January 2000 event, where Historical Novel writer Acharya Mudigonda Sivaprasad Garu was also present.

                Inspired by the occasion, Sastry Garu suggested the idea of establishing a trust in honor of his father Sri Nori Narasimha Sastry to recognize and celebrate authors annually and shared the idea with Mudigonda Garu. Encouraged by Mudigonda Garu's enthusiasm, Sri Nori Subramanya Sastry decided to move forward with the idea and to make Acharya Mudigonda Garu the first recipient of this new honor.
                
                Upon returning to Hyderabad, Sri Nori Subramanya Sastry made arrangements for the centenary celebrations and established the Nori Narasimha Sastry Charitable Trust on February 6th, the birthdate of Sri Nori Narasimha Sastry. Remarkably, the registration process was smooth, facilitated by a literary enthusiast among the registration officers, who ensured the trust's swift and efficient registration. The trust was also granted IT exemptions without delay.
                
                Thus, in 2000, the Nori Narasimha Sastry Charitable Trust was launched with a grand ceremony, honoring Acharya Mudigonda Sivaprasad Garu as the first recipient of the Nori Award.

            <p>The Nori Narasimha Sastry Charitable Trust organizes four key events annually: a meeting on Kavi Samrat Nori Narasimha Sastry’s Jayanthi (birthday), a meeting on his Vardhanthi (death anniversary) , a gathering on Guru Poornima, and an annual Vedha Sabha. </p>

                <h3 class="h3headers">Jayanthi Sabha</h3>
                <p>
                    The inaugural Jayanthi Sabha on February 6, 2000, commemorated the centenary of Nori Narasimha Sastry. This first event honored Acharya Mudigonda Sivaprasad Garu with the Nori Award. Sri Bandaru Dattatreya Garu, then a minister, attended as the chief guest. The award presented at this ceremony included a cash award of Rs. 5,000, a certificate of appreciation, and a silver plate.
    
                    Over the years, the cash prize has increased, with the award now standing at Rs. 20,000. Due to the rising cost of silver, the silver plate has been replaced with *-59+
                    a white metal plate.
                    
                    The trust’s logo, introduced in 2003, symbolizes Sri Nori Narasimha Sastry’s dedication to Sri Vidya. It features ‘Om’ with representations of Saraswati, Parvati, and Lakshmi Devi—symbolizing the beejaksharas ‘Im’, ‘Hreem’, and ‘Sreem’—within a star, encircled by a circle.
                    
                    In 2008, to honor Sri Nori Narasimha Sastry’s legacy of supporting young talent, the trust established the ‘Nori Yuva Rachayita’ Award to recognize emerging authors during the annual meeting. </p>

            <p>
                Initially, the ‘Nori Smarakopanyasamu’ was part of the Jayanthi Sabha. However, due to time constraints for the speakers, the trust decided in 2011 to separate this event and hold the ‘Smarakopanyasa’ meeting on the Vardhanthi (death anniversary) instead, in memory of Kavi Samrat Sri Nori Narasimha Sastry.
                The ‘Smarakopanyasa’ meeting focuses on a single Smarakopanyasam, a speech delivered by one speaker who explores the subject from a spiritual or literary perspective. This arrangement allows the speaker ample time to delve deeply into their topic, honoring the legacy of Sri Nori Narasimha Sastry.

                <p>
                    In 2006, the trust inaugurated the ‘Guru Puraskaras’ on Guru Purnima, celebrated during the month of Ashada. This initiative aimed to honor individuals who have made significant contributions in the role of a ‘Guru’. Eight awards were established, named in tribute to revered figures such as Veda Vyasa, Jagadguru Sri Kalyananda Bharati Mantacarya Mahaswami, Kavi Samrat Sri Nori Narasimha Sastry, Sri Kala Venkata Subba Rao, and other notable personalities. The eight awards are a symbolic representation of the belief that there is no distinction between a ‘Guru’ and Lord Shiva. Lord Shiva embodies eight aspects or forms, which include the Pancha Bhutas (the five elements: earth, water, fire, air, and ether), the Sun God, the Moon, and the Cosmic Lord. These eight manifestations underscore the unity and significance of the Guru, paralleling the divine qualities of Lord Shiva. Thus, the decision to present eight awards reflects this deep spiritual connection and reverence.
                    Recipients of the Guru Puraskaras were recognized with an introduction to their achievements, a flower garland, a shawl, and a memento. The awards quickly garnered widespread recognition and respect within the community.
                    However, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the event has been on hold since 2020

            <h2><b>Veda Sabha</b></h2>
            <div>
            <p>In 2005, Our Asthana Purohitulu Brahmasri Sri Gorantla Suryanarayana garu showed a pamphlet of Arepalli Veda Sabha to  Dr. Nori Siva Senani, Vice President of the Nori Narasimha Sastry Charitable Trust, recalled how his aunt(elder sister to Sri Nori Subramanya Sastry) once sponsored the annual Zilla Veda Sabha in Guntur and suggested the trust do something similar. The same idea was put forward by Dr. Nori Siva Senani to Sri Nori Subramanya Sastry. He immediately liked the idea. And, the trust launched the annual Veda Sabhas. These gatherings are held with the noble purpose of promoting global well-being, national prosperity, and enduring world peace. Each year, approximately 40 scholars, Pandits, and Vedic teachers participate in these sabhas. Brahmasri Yanamandra Subramanya Ghanapati serves as the President, Brahmasri Gullapalli Vishwanadha Ghanapati as the Vice President, and Brahmasri Gorantla Suryanarayana Garu presides over the proceedings. This distinctive format and purpose make the Veda Sabha a notable event. The Veda Sabha is conducted in a unique way, distinguishing it from other meetings conducted by the trust.</p>
 
            <span>The Veda Sabha follows a structured format as outlined below:</span>
               <ul>
                    <li><b>Schedule</b>: The Sabha begins at 8:30 a.m. and concludes at 7:00 p.m.</li>
                    <li><b>Program</b>:The Sabha is divided into the Samhita Bhagam, which includes seven Aavritti (cycles). Each Aavritti features recitations of Ashtaka, Ghana Pathanam, Krama Pathanam, and Brahmanamulu. Aranyakam is covered in three Aavritti cycles, while the Upanishads are addressed in the remaining cycles.</li>
                    <li><b>Procedure</b>: The President of the Sabha initiates the session with a few verses, which are then continued by pairs of Veda Pandits. These Pandits remain at the venue for the entire duration of the Sabha.</li>
                    <li><b>Vedic Recitations</b>: Depending on the availability of scholars, recitations from Rigveda, Samaveda, and Atharvaveda are included.</li>
               </ul> 
                <p>The Veda Sabha has earned significant recognition within the community. Upon completion of the Veda Sabha. Initially, scholars were rewarded with Rs. 1,000, and Kramapati received Rs. 800. Now:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Salakshana Ghanapati and Vidyaranyavetha: Rs. 7,000</li>
                    <li>Ghanapati: Rs. 6,000</li>
                    <li>Kramapati: Rs. 5,000</li>
                </ul>
                <span>Each awardee also receives a certificate of recognition.</span>
